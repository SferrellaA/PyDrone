## Background

I'm using a generic "QUADCOPTER D R O N E" that I bought from a company called "Quadair". I'm pretty sure this is just a rebrand of some other brand, but it's cheap and flies well so w/e. I want to make a python tool that can be used to controll it programatically. 

I'm not actually very good with piloting drones though lol. I'll need to practice some as part of this all. The drone uses 2.4ghz wifi for C2, so there's probably not too far of a range available on the thing.

## Today's Notes

Tried using pyrcrack, but kept running into issues with finding documentation on how to access data. Might return to it later, but the library is a bit more opinionated than I think I want to work with. For now I'm going to just try testing with direct cli. This was the command that ended up being my winner:

```
sudo airodump-ng wlan1 --essid WiFiUFO_211267 -w WiFiUFO_211267 --output-format cap
```

The manual that comes with the drone says that all drones will have their own wifi network called WiFiUFO_XXXXXX. In the future it might be possible to control multiple drones at once by listening to `--essid WiFiUFO_*` or something to that effect.

The wifi network is unencrypted, but the drone's C2 is in binary so being able to see it raw isn't the most helpful. I do notice patterns in the C2 going both ways (phone, drone) though - this can definitely be reverse engineered.

I pulled the `WiFiUFO_211267.cap` to my desktop where I can view it easier in wireshark. I briefly tried using a vs-code plugin to look at pcaps in window, but I'm working in a ssh environment and the plugin didn't quite work right. From looking at the `.cap` and filtering for ip packets, I found that:
- The drone is `192.168.28.1`
- My phone is `192.168.28.2`
- There are occasionally dns requests _from the phone for `www.google.com` and `connectivitycheck.gstatic.com`; I suspect this is the phone itself checking to see if there's any changes in internet access on the wlan
- Commands (phone to drone) are consistently 14 bytes of data in 76 byte UDP packets
- Drone->Phone packets are variable-length UDP, with _most_ packets being 1534 bytes with 1472 bytes of data

## Next Steps

I think the next thing I'm going to do is to write a script to capture packets to a new file each time I press enter on the keybaord. This way I can more cleanly split C2 into smaller pcaps to analyze.
