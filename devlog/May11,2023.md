# Thursday -- May 11, 2023

I'm writing this on the 14th but I'd already written the notes on the 11th. I just hadn't started in this devlog format.

I tried using pyrcrack on windows, but found that it is hardcoded to check if it has linux root access. On windows that doesn't work, so I tried reading through the source and found a check for an environment variable and tried setting that variable to bypass the check. That worked but then the library checks for a hardcoded linux interface, so that's no good. There's also an open issue on it's github about no windows support, so :/

I switched to using pyrcrack on a raspberry pi but couldn't get the wifi dongle I wanted to use to be detected. After some poking around I learned that the interface needs to be in `monitor` mode and that only certain wifi chipsets can support this, which the dongle I wanted to use does not. I had an old canakit usb wifi dongle though and that worked. The onboard wifi chip does not work, but this seems to be a more recent rasbian firmware change; kali's raspberry image can use the onboard chipset to monitor.

I struggled a bit with `pycrack` vs `pyrcrack`; the latter could probably have for a clearer name. It's a python wrapper for aircrack-ng (and other tools) but that's not obvous from the name.

I ended up determining these CLI commands at the end of the day. I wasn't able to get the python wrappers to work.
```
iwconfig # to see available devices
sudo iwconfig wlan1 mode monitor
sudo airodump-ng wlan1
```
